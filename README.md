# Tanzanian Water Well Data Project


## Business Opportunity

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, we will predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all. We will form predictions based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
